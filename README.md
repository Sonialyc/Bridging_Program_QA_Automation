# Sonia's QA Automation Learning Repository

Welcome to my QA Automation Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing my journey as a QA Automation student, focusing on my Automating Tests for LinkedIn Website Project (test_LinkedIn_Project). It serves as a testament to my growth and progress in the field.

## About the Repository

As a passionate learner in QA Automation, this repository is a space where I store and share the QA automation project that demonstrates my skills and expertise in automating LinkedIn interactions. This project showcases how I apply QA principles and automation techniques to ensure the quality and reliability of LinkedIn activities.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several sections, each representing a key aspect of my "Automating Tests for LinkedIn Website Project (test_LinkedIn_Project)":

- **Pages**: This directory contains the page objects and locators used in the project. It encapsulates the web page elements and their interactions, enhancing the maintainability and readability of the automation scripts.

- **Resources**: The "resources" folder includes essential constants used throughout the project, such as wait intervals and URL.

- **Tests**: In the "tests" directory, you'll find a comprehensive suite of test cases and scripts that demonstrate the application of QA principles. These tests cover various LinkedIn interactions, ensuring the quality and reliability of LinkedIn activities.

- **Test Reports**: The "test_reports" directory stores XML and HTML reports generated for the test scenarios. These reports provide detailed insights into test results, making it easier to analyze outcomes and identify areas for improvement.

- **Automation Frameworks**: I also delve into various test automation frameworks and tools that I've used to create this project, demonstrating my proficiency in automation technologies.

## Automation Approach

In my "Automating Tests for LinkedIn Website Project (test_LinkedIn_Project)," I employ a robust automation approach that utilizes the following tools and technologies:

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: PyCharm serves as my primary IDE, offering a seamless environment for coding and test development.

- **Programming Language**: Python is my language of choice for automation scripting, known for its simplicity and extensive library support.

- **Automation Framework**: Selenium WebDriver forms the backbone of my automation efforts, enabling interaction with web elements and browsers.

- **Libraries**: I leverage essential libraries to enhance my test automation suite, such as:
  - **pytest**: For efficient test management. 
  - **time**: Imported to handle time-related functions. 
  - **pillow**: For image processing capabilities. 
  - **autoit**: Utilized for attaching an image and sending it via LinkedIn messaging to a connection. 
  - **JavaScript**: Used to interact with web elements using JavaScript, enhancing test capabilities. 
  - **junit-xml**: For generating structured JUnit-style XML reports. 
  - **pytest-html**: For producing informative HTML test reports.


### Page Object Model (POM)

The project embraces the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, a fundamental approach to organizing test automation code. POM promotes maintainability by encapsulating web page elements and interactions into dedicated page objects, streamlining test script development.

### Browser Testing

All test scenarios within the project are meticulously executed in the Google Chrome browser, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and reliable results. Additionally, it's also compatible with the Edge browser.

### Poetry Environment

To manage project dependencies and maintain a consistent and isolated testing environment, I employ Poetry, a dedicated dependency management tool. Poetry simplifies the process of installing, updating, and handling project packages, ensuring a stable and predictable test execution environment.

### Test Reporting

Comprehensive test reports play a pivotal role in tracking test results and identifying issues. The project utilizes junit-xml and pytest-html to generate detailed reports, making it easier to analyze test outcomes and pinpoint areas for improvement.

## Getting Started
